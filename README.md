The coinversor blog code for your confidence.

The coinversor blog simply gets the Solana price from the Binance API and calculate the SOL equivalency of 5 and 10 Euros with +1% of slippage.

Additionally let the user copy this 5/10 Euros in SOL value and our public wallet address as transaction helper for our projects.
